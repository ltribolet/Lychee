### Settings

Sign in and click the gear in the top left corner to change your settings. [Settings &#187;][1]

### Build

Lychee is ready to use, right out of the box. If you want to contribute and edit CSS or JS files, you need to rebuild [Lychee-front](https://github.com/LycheeOrg/Lychee-front). [Build &#187;](https://lycheeorg.github.io/docs/node.html)

## Advanced Features

Lychee is ready to use straight after installation, but some features require a little more configuration.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

These shortcuts will help you to use Lychee even faster. [Keyboard Shortcuts &#187;](https://lycheeorg.github.io/docs/keyboard.html)

### Dropbox import

In order to use the Dropbox import from your server, you need a valid drop-ins app key from [their website](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create). Lychee will ask you for this key, the first time you try to use the import. Want to change your code? Take a look at [the settings][1] of Lychee.

### Twitter Cards

Lychee supports [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards) and [Open Graph](http://opengraphprotocol.org) for shared images (not albums). In order to use Twitter Cards you need to request an approval for your domain. Simply share an image with Lychee, copy its link and paste it in [Twitters Card Validator](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards/validation/validator).

### Imagick

Lychee uses [Imagick](https://www.imagemagick.org) when installed on your server. In this case you will benefit from a faster processing of your uploads, better looking thumbnails and intermediate sized images for small screen devices. You can disable the usage of [Imagick](https://www.imagemagick.org) in the [settings][1].
